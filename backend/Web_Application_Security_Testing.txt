1. Background of INSA 
The Information Network Security Administration (INSA) is Ethiopia’s leading government body entrusted with safeguarding the country’s digital infrastructure and cyber ecosystem. Established with a vision to ensure national cyber sovereignty and resilience, INSA performs critical functions such as conducting cyber security audits, providing policy direction, issuing compliance guidelines, and offering technical support across various governmental and private institutions. 
INSA’s Cyber Security Audit Division assesses the security posture of digital platforms including web applications, APIs, mobile applications, internal portals, and IT infrastructures. Our assessments identify vulnerabilities and recommend mitigation strategies aligned with global best practices. 
2. Introduction 
This document outlines the key requirements and submission expectations for organizations undergoing web application security testing with INSA. The aim is to ensure robustness, confidentiality, and integrity of digital assets by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities. INSA applies leading methodologies and standards including OWASP Top 10, NIST guidelines, and ISO/IEC 27001. 
3. Objectives of the Audit Request 
These assessments are vital for: 
	Mitigating cyber risks and vulnerabilities. 
	Ensuring compliance with Ethiopian and international cybersecurity standards. 
	Strengthening the trust of stakeholders and customers. 
	Safeguarding sensitive data and operations from cyber threats. 
4. Required Submissions from the Client 
You must submit the following via INSA’s Audit Request Portal. If submissions include sensitive files (e.g., source code or APK files), deliver those specific files on CD/DVD to INSA’s office or mail them to the address provided.

	API endpoints with request/response structures 
	Role-based access control definitions 
	Logging and auditing functionalities  Error handling and exception management 
4.2.4 Non-Functional Requirements 
The application must document non-functional behaviors affecting security and performance: 
	Performance: Expected response times, concurrent users, throughput 
	Availability: Uptime requirements, failover mechanisms 
	Scalability: Horizontal/vertical scaling plans 
	Reliability: Backup and disaster recovery processes 
	Maintainability: Code modularity, documentation, update procedures 
	Security: Encryption, authentication, authorization, session management, and audit logging. 
 
 
 
4.2.5 Threat Modeling 
Customers must provide threat modeling documentation to support security analysis: 
	Identified threats (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, privilege escalation, etc.) 
	Risk assessment for each threat (impact, likelihood, mitigation priority) 
	Mitigation strategies implemented or planned 
	Attack surface analysis (entry points, exposed APIs, third-party integrations) 
	Security assumptions and dependencies Required Submission:
